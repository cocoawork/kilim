# **Kilim**: Continuations, Fibers, Actors and message passing for the JVM

Kilim is composed of 2 primary components:
* The Kilim weaver modifies the bytecode of compiled java classes, enabling a method to save it's state
and yield control of it's thread, ie to cooperatively multitask
* The Kilim runtime library provides constructs that leverage the weaver to simplify concurrent programming, including Coroutines, Task, Actors, Mailboxes (aka channels), and Generators


Together, these facilities allow for simple concurrency and can scale to millions of concurrent tasks



## Usage

Code can be woven:
* during compilation by using the maven plugin
* during compilation by running `kilim.tools.Weaver`
* at runtime by invoking `kilim.tools.Kilim com.yourcompany.yourclass`
* at runtime by including `if (kilim.tools.Kilim.trampoline(false,args)) return;` at the start of main()




## Writing code with Kilim

Please see docs/manual.txt and docs/kilim_ecoop08.pdf for a brief
introduction.

* `src/kilim/examples` contains some simple examples
* `src/kilim/bench` contains some performance benchmarks
* [kilim streams](https://github.com/nqzero/kilim-streams) is a port of java 8 streams to kilim
* [java empower](https://github.com/nqzero/jempower) is a comparison of several async web server techs
  * `kj/src/main/java/KilimJetty.java` shows integrating with jetty async
  * `kilim/src/main/java/KilimHello.java` shows the built-in kilim web server (which in addition to doing async connections also does async io)

#### "hello world" in kilim

for an example of a project that uses kilim (with the trampoline for runtime weaving) see the
[battle royale demo in this repository](https://github.com/nqzero/kilim/tree/master/demos/battle).
clone this repository, and from that directory execute `mvn package exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=kilim.demo.Battle`


## Maven

for an example of a project that uses kilim, see 
the [kilim jetty demo in this repository](https://github.com/nqzero/kilim/tree/master/demos/jetty)
- the `pom.xml` specifies kilim as both a dependency and a plugin for ahead-of-time weaving


the dependency:

```
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.db4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>kilim</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.0-14</version>
    </dependency>
```

weaving with the kilim plugin:

```
    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.db4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>kilim</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.0-14</version>
        <executions>
            <execution>
                <goals><goal>weave</goal></goals>
            </execution>
        </executions>
    </plugin>
```



## Overview

* java.lang.Runnable:   once a java.lang.Task starts running, it takes over the thread until it returns

* kilim.Continuation:  like java.lang.Runnable, but can yield (relinquish control of the thread) while preserving state. Itâ€™s caller must arrange to resume it at some appropriate time. Used for event-driven state machines where the event loop knows when to resume. The programmer is in charge of the event loop.

* kilim.Task:  like kilim.Continuation, but specifies a reason that it yields, and a scheduler automatically resumes it when the reason is no longer true. Typically used for a system of communicating state machines that communicate using Mailboxes. Releases the programmer from the job of mapping fibers to thread and of managing an event loop and the delivery of events.

* kilim.Pausable: a hypothetical exception used to declare intent. a method that declares this to be thrown will trigger the weaver

* kilim.Mailbox: a queue with Pausable methods that cause the calling Task method to yield when an operation would otherwise block and to resume automatically when the Mailbox because available for reading or writing

* kilim.Fiber: the structure that stores the Continuation (and Task) state


## Support

public support:
* [the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kilimthreads)
* [github issues](https://github.com/nqzero/kilim/issues)



nqzero is currently the primary maintainer.
he's primarily interested in making Kilim easy to use and reliable and is actively using Kilim

Sriram is the original author (in 2006 !) and deserves a great deal of thanks for his excellent work.
He continues to provide guidance on kilim and is especially interested in theory and performance,
but is not actively using kilim today.

## Building


summary:

* the primary build/test environment is ant
* maven is used for downloading dependencies (or manually copy them to ./libs - see pom.xml)
  * only needs to be done once
  * `mvn initialize` (but any pom-based mvn command should work too)
  * when upgrading versions, delete the old dependencies in `./libs`
* maven can also be used for building, but tests are disabled
* there's a kilim maven plugin, but it's not used here to avoid a circular dependency - the weaver is run directly instead (using ant)
  * the plugin is only built during the maven build, but once built will be packaged by the ant build
  * to include in an ant build, perform the build as normal, then run `mvn package`, and then rerun the
ant packaging, typically `ant jar`

simple:
`mvn install`

build with tests:
`ant clean testjit test jar doc`

details:
* testjit runs the tests (after compiling) using the runtime weaver
* test runs the tests using the compile-time weaver, as well as some tests that don't require weaving
* doc generates sources.jar and javadoc.jar
* `mvn install:install-file -DpomFile=pom.xml -Dfile=target/kilim.jar -Dsources=target/sources.jar -Djavadoc=target/javadoc.jar`
* java 8 is the recommended platform, but should build (with ant), run and test under both 6 and 7



## java 7
  * `JAVA_HOME=path/to/java7 ant clean weave jar`
  * `mvn install:install-file -DpomFile=pom.xml -Dfile=target/kilim.jar -Dclassifier=jdk7`
  * see demos/java7 for an example java 7 project
  * not all features are available in java 7



## Running

with runtime weaver:
```
ant clean compile

# using the runtime weaver
java -cp "target/classes:libs/*" kilim.tools.Kilim kilim.examples.PerfTest

# Userdata calls the trampoline (implicitly triggers the runtime weaver)
java -cp "target/classes:libs/*" kilim.examples.Userdata

# run the compile-time weaver
ant weave

# run woven code
java -cp "target/classes:libs/*" kilim.examples.PerfTest
```
